First, you need to install the compiler package.

- You need VS.NET2008
  If you want to build the msi make sure the "Tools for Redistributing
  Applications" are installed.
  Also, you need the MFC feature pack which contains the tr1 c-runtime
  extensions (or the SP1 for VS2008 which contains the feature pack).

Next you need to install some utilities/programs:
- Python 2.4(*)           : http://www.python.org/windows/
- Perl                    : http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/
- WiX 3(*)                : http://wix.sourceforge.net
- NAnt(*)                 : http://nant.sourceforge.net

(*) Add the paths of the binaries to the PATH environment variable
    You may have to logoff/logon to make the new environment variables take effect!

Now you're almost ready. Only a few more steps to do:
- create a new folder on your harddisk, e.g. SVN.
- Checkout the CommitMonitor sources from the Subversion repository into
  SVN\CommitMonitor
- Make a copy of the file default.build.user.tmpl in the CommitMonitor root folder and
  rename that copy to default.build.user. Then adjust the paths as mentioned
  in that file.


Building packages

  Hint: before you can start building CommitMonitor, you need to call the vsvars32.bat
  file which is located in %VS90COMNTOOLS%. 
  
  > nant
  will show you some help about the targets you can use

  > nant setup
  will compile everything and create the msi installer

  > nant Subversion
  will build all the libraries required. After that you can open the
  .sln file in VS2008 and compile the CommitMonitor there.
  Don't forget to also build the debug versions of the libraries:
  > nant debug Subversion
  
  
  If you encounter any build errors, you can run nant again like this:

  > nant setup -l:buildlog.txt

  which will create a build log file which you can use to analyse where
  exactly the build failed.


  After the script finished, the packages can be found in .\bin .
